My little pet Awesome React project.

Unprofessional interactive portfolio.

Instead of long boring cookie-cutter lies about "mastered this" and "accomplished that" it will in a silly and whimsical way show you some samples of my web development and also random facts about me.

You'll get to click a lot of buttons (by the way that's my favorite thing about coding - make all the buttons click).

For making it through each block of info you get rewarded with a glorious achievement.

Enjoy (or hate):
