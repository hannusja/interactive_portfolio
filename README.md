My little pet Awesome React project.
Unprofessional interactive portfolio.
Instead long boring cookie-cutter lies about "mastered this" and "accomplished that" it will in a silly and whimsical way show you some samples of my web development and also random facts about me.
You'll get to click a lot of buttons (that's my favorite thing about coding - make the buttons click).
For making it through each block of info you get rewarded with a glorious achievment.

Enjoy (or hate):
